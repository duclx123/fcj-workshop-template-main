Master core concepts of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), including users, groups, and roles. Build a secure and isolated cloud network infrastructure with Amazon VPC and a Site-to-Site VPN. Launch, configure, and manage virtual servers using Amazon EC2. Securely grant AWS service permissions to applications running on EC2 using IAM Roles. Tasks to be carried out this week: Day Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material 2 - Learn to monitor and control AWS costs with AWS Budgets.\n- Understand different types of budgets available.\n- Practice:\n+ Create a Cost Budget to track overall spending against a set amount.\n+ Create a Usage Budget to monitor specific service consumption.\n+ Explore Reservation \u0026amp; Savings Plans Budgets for commitment tracking. 08/09/2025 08/09/2025 AWS Study Group 3 - Learn the fundamentals of IAM: Users, Groups, Policies, and Roles.\n- Follow security best practices for the root user.\n- Practice:\n+ Create an Admin Group with AdministratorAccess policy.\n+ Create a new IAM User and add it to the Admin Group.\n+ Understand how to create and use an IAM Role.\n+ Practice using the Switch Role feature. 09/09/2025 09/09/2025 AWS Study Group 4 - Learn to build a secure, custom network with Amazon VPC.\n- Understand VPC components: subnets, route tables, internet gateways.\n- Practice:\n+ Create a VPC with public and private subnets.\n+ Configure Security Groups as a stateful firewall.\n+ Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC.\n+ Establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection. 10/09/2025 10/09/2025 AWS Study Group 5 - Get introduced to Amazon EC2 core concepts.\n- Deploy applications on different operating systems.\n- Practice:\n+ Launch a Windows Server 2022 instance and connect via RDP.\n+ Launch an Amazon Linux 2 instance and connect via SSH.\n+ Deploy a user management application on both instances.\n+ Implement cost governance for EC2 usage. 11/09/2025 11/09/2025 AWS Study Group 6 - Understand why hardcoding access keys in applications is a security risk.\n- Learn to use IAM Roles for EC2 to grant secure permissions.\n- Practice:\n+ Prepare an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance.\n+ Create an IAM Role with S3 access permissions.\n+ Attach the role to the EC2 instance.\n+ Verify the application can access S3 without access keys. 12/09/2025 12/09/2025 AWS Study Group Week 1 Achievements Cost Management Successfully created and configured AWS Budgets to monitor costs and usage. Practiced setting up different types of budgets, including Cost Budgets, Usage Budgets, Reservation Budgets, and Savings Plans Budgets. Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) Mastered the creation of IAM users and groups to manage permissions effectively. Understood the principle of least privilege by creating an Admin user/group. Learned how to create and use IAM Roles for secure delegation of permissions and practiced using Switch Roles. Network Infrastructure (VPC \u0026amp; VPN) Built a complete, custom Amazon VPC including subnets, an internet gateway, and route tables. Configured network security using Security Groups to act as a firewall for EC2 instances. Successfully established a Site-to-Site VPN connection, simulating a hybrid cloud environment. Compute with Amazon EC2 Launched both Microsoft Windows Server and Amazon Linux 2 instances on EC2. Gained hands-on experience connecting to and performing basic administration on virtual servers. Deployed a sample user management application on both Linux and Windows environments. Implemented cost \u0026amp; usage governance strategies related to EC2. Secure Application Integration Understood the security risks of using static access keys within applications. Successfully created an IAM Role for EC2 to grant an application temporary, secure permissions to other AWS services. Verified that an application running on EC2 could access resources (like S3) without needing hardcoded credentials.

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

Executive Summary Mini Food Social is a fully serverless, AI-enhanced social platform built for food enthusiasts.\nIt enables users to share posts, upload food images, and generate new recipe ideas through AI.\nThe system supports up to 100 registered users, providing authentication, CRUD functionality, and interactive features such as likes and comments.\nThe architecture leverages AWS managed services for scalability, cost efficiency, and minimal operational overhead:\nAWS Amplify (Next.js frontend hosting \u0026amp; CI/CD) Amazon API Gateway + AWS Lambda (backend APIs) Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL data store) Amazon Bedrock (AI text generation) Amazon Cognito (authentication) Amazon CloudFront + WAF + Route 53 (secure content delivery) This solution provides an affordable, production-ready foundation for modern serverless applications.\n2. Problem Statement The Problem Traditional recipe-sharing apps lack personalization and dynamic engagement.\nUsers increasingly seek:\nInteractive communities (posting, liking, commenting) Smart recipe generation using AI Reliable authentication and security However, such platforms often demand heavy backend infrastructure and high costs.\nThe Solution Mini Food Social employs a fully serverless and event-driven AWS stack:\nAmplify hosts and deploys the frontend via GitLab CI/CD. Cognito manages secure sign-in/sign-up and JWT tokens. API Gateway connects requests to Lambda functions. Lambda Router delegates tasks to handlers for posts, profiles, and AI requests. Bedrock generates personalized recipes using user prompts. CloudFront + WAF ensure fast and secure traffic delivery. Benefits and Return on Investment Low operational cost — Pay only for actual usage. Highly scalable — Auto-scales with user demand. AI-powered engagement — Improves user retention and creativity. Secure and compliant — Cognito authentication and encrypted data in DynamoDB \u0026amp; S3. Estimated Monthly Cost (No Free Tier): ≈ $16.70 USD\nAnnual Cost: ≈ $200.40 USD\n3. Solution Architecture The system follows a five-layer serverless architecture that ensures modularity, scalability, and cost control.\nAt the CI/CD Layer, GitLab automates deployments — pushing frontend code to AWS Amplify and provisioning backend infrastructure via AWS CDK and CloudFormation.\nThe Edge Layer secures and routes all requests using Amazon Route 53 for DNS, WAF for traffic filtering, and CloudFront for global content caching.\nSSL/TLS certificates are automatically managed by AWS Amplify (no separate ACM required).\nCloudFront communicates privately with S3 using an Origin Access Identity (OAI).\nIn the Application Layer, Amplify hosts the Next.js frontend, while API Gateway and Lambda handle backend logic. Cognito authenticates users and manages tokens for API access.\nThe Data Storage Layer uses DynamoDB for core data, S3 for image storage, and EventBridge for asynchronous tasks (e.g., post notifications).\nFinally, the Observability Layer integrates CloudWatch (logs \u0026amp; metrics), X-Ray (request tracing), and SNS (alerting), ensuring transparency and reliability.\nAWS Services Used Category Services Frontend \u0026amp; CI/CD AWS Amplify (Next.js), GitLab, AWS CDK, CloudFormation Edge \u0026amp; Security Route 53, CloudFront, WAF Application \u0026amp; Compute API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito Data \u0026amp; AI DynamoDB (single-table), S3, Amazon Bedrock Observability \u0026amp; Events CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS, EventBridge Component Design User Access: User → CloudFront → Amplify (Frontend) Authentication: Amplify → Cognito (Hosted UI redirect) API Calls: Amplify → Route 53 → CloudFront → WAF → API Gateway API Authorization: API Gateway → Cognito Authorizer Backend Logic: API Router Lambda → DynamoDB / S3 / Bedrock AI Recipes: AI Handler Lambda → Bedrock (Claude model) Image Delivery: CloudFront → S3 (via OAI) Events \u0026amp; Logs: EventBridge, CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS 4.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone.

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"},{"uri":"https://duclx123.github.io/fcj-workshop-template-main/en/1-worklog/1.5-week5/","title":"Week 5 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 5 Objectives: Learn how to monitor system performance and collect logs using Amazon CloudWatch.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them.
