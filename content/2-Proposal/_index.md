# Mini Food Social  
## A Serverless Social Platform with AI-Powered Recipe Generation

### 1. Executive Summary
**Mini Food Social** is a lightweight, serverless social web application built for food enthusiasts.  
It allows users to share, discover, and generate new recipes through AI.  
The platform supports up to **50 registered users**, featuring authentication, post creation, image upload, and AI-generated recipe suggestions.  

The system uses a **fully serverless AWS architecture**:
- **AWS Amplify** (Next.js frontend hosting & CI/CD)
- **Amazon API Gateway** + **AWS Lambda** (backend APIs)
- **Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL data store)
- **Amazon Bedrock** (AI text generation)
- **Amazon Cognito** (user authentication)
- **Amazon CloudFront + WAF + ACM + Route 53** (secure edge delivery)

The solution is scalable, cost-efficient, and production-ready while remaining affordable for small-scale deployments.

---

### 2. Problem Statement
#### What‚Äôs the Problem?
Existing recipe-sharing platforms are static and lack personalization.  
Users want:
- Community-driven interaction (likes, comments, sharing)
- AI-assisted recipe ideas based on ingredients or mood  
- Simple but secure authentication  

However, building a scalable platform with these capabilities often requires complex backend management and expensive compute resources.

#### The Solution
**Mini Food Social** leverages AWS Serverless to eliminate backend management overhead.  
Using an event-driven, pay-per-use model:
- **Amplify** hosts the web UI and handles deployment via GitLab CI/CD.  
- **Cognito** manages sign-in/sign-up and JWT-based authentication.  
- **API Gateway** routes requests to Lambda functions.  
- **Router Lambda** coordinates specialized handlers for posts, user profiles, and AI interactions.  
- **Bedrock** generates recipes dynamically using user prompts.  
- **CloudFront + WAF** protect the app from malicious traffic.  

---

### Benefits and Return on Investment
- **Low-cost scalability** ‚Äî Pay only per request; ideal for small teams or demo apps.  
- **Modern serverless stack** ‚Äî No infrastructure maintenance.  
- **AI integration** ‚Äî Increases engagement and user retention.  
- **Secure & compliant** ‚Äî Managed auth (Cognito) and encrypted data (S3, DynamoDB).  

**Estimated Monthly Cost (No Free Tier): ‚âà $32.60 USD**  
**Annual Cost: ‚âà $391.20 USD**  

---

### 3. Solution Architecture
The platform adopts a five-layer serverless architecture built entirely on AWS to ensure scalability, maintainability, and cost efficiency.

At the CI/CD Layer, GitLab automates both frontend and backend deployments ‚Äî pushing frontend updates to AWS Amplify and provisioning backend infrastructure via AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation.

The Edge Layer secures all inbound traffic through Amazon Route 53 for domain management, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL encryption, AWS WAF for web application firewall protection, and Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery. CloudFront communicates privately with S3 using an Origin Access Identity (OAI) to ensure secure asset access.

Within the Application Layer, AWS Amplify hosts the Next.js frontend, while Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda manage backend API requests. Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and JWT token validation for all user interactions.

The Data Storage Layer leverages Amazon DynamoDB for the main application data, Amazon S3 for storing media and images, and Amazon EventBridge for asynchronous communication and scheduled workflows.

Lastly, the Observability Layer integrates Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, AWS X-Ray for request tracing and performance visualization, and Amazon SNS for real-time alerting and notifications ‚Äî ensuring transparency, reliability, and operational efficiency across the platform.
