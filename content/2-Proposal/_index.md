# Mini Food Social  
## A Serverless Social Platform with AI-Powered Recipe Generation

### 1. Executive Summary
**Mini Food Social** is a fully serverless, AI-enhanced social platform built for food enthusiasts.  
It enables users to share posts, upload food images, and generate new recipe ideas through AI.  
The system supports up to **100 registered users**, providing authentication, CRUD functionality, and interactive features such as likes and comments.

The architecture leverages **AWS managed services** for scalability, cost efficiency, and minimal operational overhead:
- **AWS Amplify** (Next.js frontend hosting & CI/CD)
- **Amazon API Gateway** + **AWS Lambda** (backend APIs)
- **Amazon DynamoDB** (NoSQL data store)
- **Amazon Bedrock** (AI text generation)
- **Amazon Cognito** (authentication)
- **Amazon CloudFront + WAF + Route 53** (secure content delivery)

This solution provides an affordable, production-ready foundation for modern serverless applications.

---

### 2. Problem Statement
#### The Problem
Traditional recipe-sharing apps lack personalization and dynamic engagement.  
Users increasingly seek:
- Interactive communities (posting, liking, commenting)
- Smart recipe generation using AI  
- Reliable authentication and security  

However, such platforms often demand heavy backend infrastructure and high costs.

#### The Solution
**Mini Food Social** employs a fully **serverless** and **event-driven** AWS stack:
- **Amplify** hosts and deploys the frontend via GitLab CI/CD.  
- **Cognito** manages secure sign-in/sign-up and JWT tokens.  
- **API Gateway** connects requests to Lambda functions.  
- **Lambda Router** delegates tasks to handlers for posts, profiles, and AI requests.  
- **Bedrock** generates personalized recipes using user prompts.  
- **CloudFront + WAF** ensure fast and secure traffic delivery.  

---

### Benefits and Return on Investment
- **Low operational cost** — Pay only for actual usage.  
- **Highly scalable** — Auto-scales with user demand.  
- **AI-powered engagement** — Improves user retention and creativity.  
- **Secure and compliant** — Cognito authentication and encrypted data in DynamoDB & S3.  

**Estimated Monthly Cost (No Free Tier): ≈ $16.70 USD**  
**Annual Cost: ≈ $200.40 USD**

---

### 3. Solution Architecture
The system follows a **five-layer serverless architecture** that ensures modularity, scalability, and cost control.

At the **CI/CD Layer**, GitLab automates deployments — pushing frontend code to **AWS Amplify** and provisioning backend infrastructure via **AWS CDK** and **CloudFormation**.

The **Edge Layer** secures and routes all requests using **Amazon Route 53** for DNS, **WAF** for traffic filtering, and **CloudFront** for global content caching.  
SSL/TLS certificates are automatically managed by **AWS Amplify** (no separate ACM required).  
CloudFront communicates privately with **S3** using an **Origin Access Identity (OAI)**.

In the **Application Layer**, Amplify hosts the **Next.js frontend**, while **API Gateway** and **Lambda** handle backend logic. **Cognito** authenticates users and manages tokens for API access.

The **Data Storage Layer** uses **DynamoDB** for core data, **S3** for image storage, and **EventBridge** for asynchronous tasks (e.g., post notifications).

Finally, the **Observability Layer** integrates **CloudWatch** (logs & metrics), **X-Ray** (request tracing), and **SNS** (alerting), ensuring transparency and reliability.
