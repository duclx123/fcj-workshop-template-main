### Week 6 Achievements

#### 1. Serverless Fundamentals
- Understood the benefits of serverless design (no server management, auto-scaling, pay-per-use).  
- Created and tested basic **Lambda functions** triggered manually and via API events.  

#### 2. API Gateway Integration
- Built a **REST API** with **Amazon API Gateway** connected to **Lambda**.  
- Deployed multiple stages (dev, prod) and tested public access successfully.  

#### 3. DynamoDB Integration
- Designed a **DynamoDB** table with efficient key structure for fast access.  
- Integrated Lambda to perform **CRUD operations** directly from serverless functions.  
- Tested full API-Lambda-DynamoDB workflow end-to-end.  

#### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Automated deployment of serverless architecture using **CloudFormation** templates.  
- Managed stack creation, updates, and teardown in a reproducible way.  

#### 5. Monitoring and Automation
- Implemented **CloudWatch Logs and Alarms** to detect runtime issues.  
- Used **EventBridge** to trigger alerts or workflows based on Lambda events.  
- Strengthened observability, reliability, and automation in the serverless environment.
