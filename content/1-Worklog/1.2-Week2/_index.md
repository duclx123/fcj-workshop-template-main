### Week 2 Objectives:

* Deepen understanding of **Amazon EC2** and related storage services (**EBS**).  
* Learn how to store and retrieve data securely using **Amazon S3**.  
* Understand database deployment and connectivity through **Amazon RDS**.  
* Integrate EC2 applications with S3 and RDS to form a complete backend stack.  
* Practice monitoring and cost optimization for compute and storage resources.

### Week 2 Achievements

### Compute & Storage Mastery
- Successfully created and attached **EBS volumes** to EC2 instances across different operating systems.  
- Practiced **snapshotting** and restoring volumes for backup and recovery scenarios.  
- Understood volume lifecycle management and pricing models.

### Object Storage with Amazon S3
- Deployed multiple **S3 buckets** with access control and versioning enabled.  
- Configured **Lifecycle Policies** to transition objects between storage tiers automatically.  
- Learned to enforce data security using **Bucket Policies** and **ACLs**.

### Database Integration (Amazon RDS)
- Launched and configured a **MySQL RDS instance** within a private subnet.  
- Connected EC2 applications securely to RDS using VPC routing and IAM-based access.  
- Practiced database administration: table creation, queries, and snapshots.

### Application Integration
- Wrote and executed scripts to upload/download files between EC2 and S3 using **IAM Roles** instead of static credentials.  
- Verified the end-to-end data flow between **EC2 → S3 → RDS**, forming a functional backend stack.

### Cost & Performance Optimization
- Monitored usage metrics with **Amazon CloudWatch** and **AWS Cost Explorer**.  
- Identified idle resources and optimized EBS/S3 configurations for efficiency.  
- Improved overall awareness of cost management strategies for compute and storage layers.
