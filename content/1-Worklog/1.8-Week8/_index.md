### Week 8 Achievements

#### 1. VPC Peering & Transit Gateway
- Successfully established **VPC peering connections** and tested cross-VPC traffic.  
- Configured **Transit Gateway** to centralize routing across multiple VPCs.  

#### 2. AWS PrivateLink
- Created **PrivateLink endpoints** for secure, private access to AWS services.  
- Verified that traffic bypassed the public internet, improving security.  

#### 3. AWS Direct Connect
- Configured **dedicated network connections** using Direct Connect.  
- Tested routing and bandwidth improvements for hybrid connectivity.  

#### 4. Hybrid Cloud Integration
- Connected on-premises network with AWS using **VPN + Direct Connect**.  
- Tested failover, routing, and hybrid communication reliability.  

#### 5. Network Monitoring & Security
- Enabled **VPC Flow Logs** and analyzed traffic patterns.  
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for network performance anomalies.  
- Applied **Security Groups** and **NACLs** to enforce best practices.
