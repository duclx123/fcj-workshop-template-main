### Week 3 Objectives:

* Learn how to design a **highly available and scalable** infrastructure on AWS.  
* Implement **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** and **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** for automatic traffic distribution and instance scaling.  
* Configure **Amazon Route 53** for domain management and DNS routing.  
* Strengthen system reliability through **data backup** and **monitoring** solutions.  
* Practice analyzing performance metrics and responding to scaling events.

### Week 3 Achievements

#### 1. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Deployed and configured an **Application Load Balancer** distributing traffic across multiple EC2 instances.  
- Validated load balancing and failover mechanisms through performance testing.  
- Understood the difference between **Application**, **Network**, and **Gateway** Load Balancers.  

#### 2. Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
- Successfully created and tested an **Auto Scaling Group** using a **Launch Template**.  
- Implemented **target tracking** and **step scaling policies** based on CPU utilization.  
- Verified automatic scaling actions and instance replacement during health check failures.  

#### 3. Amazon Route 53
- Configured DNS routing for web applications through **Route 53 Hosted Zones**.  
- Linked **Route 53 records** with the **Load Balancer DNS name** for domain access.  
- Gained insights into **routing policies** such as Simple, Weighted, and Failover.  

#### 4. Backup and Recovery
- Created and validated **EBS snapshots** and **RDS automated backups**.  
- Implemented S3-based **backup storage and lifecycle management**.  
- Successfully restored resources from snapshots to ensure disaster recovery readiness.  

#### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to detect performance anomalies.  
- Monitored **ASG scaling events**, **ELB request metrics**, and **RDS performance** dashboards.  
- Tracked API activities and user actions using **AWS CloudTrail**, improving overall visibility and governance.
