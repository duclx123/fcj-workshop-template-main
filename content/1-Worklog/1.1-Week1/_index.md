### Week 1 Achievements

## Cost Management
-   Successfully created and configured **AWS Budgets** to monitor costs and usage.
-   Practiced setting up different types of budgets, including **Cost Budgets**, **Usage Budgets**, **Reservation Budgets**, and **Savings Plans Budgets**.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM)
-   Mastered the creation of **IAM users** and **groups** to manage permissions effectively.
-   Understood the principle of least privilege by creating an **Admin user/group**.
-   Learned how to create and use **IAM Roles** for secure delegation of permissions and practiced using **Switch Roles**.

## Network Infrastructure (VPC & VPN)
-   Built a complete, custom **Amazon VPC** including subnets, an internet gateway, and route tables.
-   Configured network security using **Security Groups** to act as a firewall for EC2 instances.
-   Successfully established a **Site-to-Site VPN** connection, simulating a hybrid cloud environment.

## Compute with Amazon EC2
-   Launched both **Microsoft Windows Server** and **Amazon Linux 2** instances on EC2.
-   Gained hands-on experience connecting to and performing basic administration on virtual servers.
-   Deployed a sample **user management application** on both Linux and Windows environments.
-   Implemented **cost & usage governance** strategies related to EC2.

## Secure Application Integration
-   Understood the security risks of using static access keys within applications.
-   Successfully created an **IAM Role for EC2** to grant an application temporary, secure permissions to other AWS services.
-   Verified that an application running on EC2 could access resources (like S3) without needing hardcoded credentials.
